Facial emotion detection is a rapidly advancing field within artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision, aimed at recognizing and classifying human emotions based on facial expressions. This paper presents a machine learning approach for detecting emotions from facial images using machine learning techniques which has emerged as a pivotal technology with wide-ranging applications. Our study introduces a novel approach to facial emotion detection, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to interpret and analyse facial expressions. The primary objective of this research is to develop a robust system that accurately identifies human emotions through facial analysis, thereby providing valuable insights into the user's emotional state. Utilizing datasets like the FER2013, and self-created dataset, we explore different machine learning architectures, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF). The proposed system captures images via a webcam, processes these images to extract key facial features, and then classifies the emotions using the most effective algorithms.
The model achieves robust performance by capturing the subtle variations in facial expressions, thus enabling real-time emotion recognition in images and video streams. OpenCV is utilized for face detection and real-time emotion classification using live video feeds. The proposed solution can be applied to several domains, including human-computer interaction, mental health monitoring, and customer sentiment analysis. This research explores the challenges of emotion recognition, such as varying lighting conditions, occlusions, and the subjective nature of emotions.
